# FlowerProject
This repo contains projects related to flower data that I collected on my own for Research purposes.

# Classification of flower data 
This project classifies flower growth into 3 stages. Stage1- Bud stage, Stage2- Closed flower, Stage3- Fully grown flower. Used MobileNet for feature extraction and SVM for classification.Accuracy of 97% is achieved.

# Segmentation_pixellib
Employing TensorFlow-Hub models was utilized. The DeepLab's Edge TPU[3] model was chosen to extract semantic features through segmentation. 

# Color_descriptors
The mean color value method involves computing the average color of pixels within a specified region of an image. This technique is commonly used in image processing to quantify color characteristics.

# FeatureVsTime
Examining the temporal evolution of features, specifically Feature 0 and Feature 1, through visualization using Matplotlib.
